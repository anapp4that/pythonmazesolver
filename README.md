# Python Maze solver
project.py contains the main function and global variables
pixels.py contains our methods to parse our maze from our Image
   from pixels.py we also can get the entry and exit points of our maze
state.py holds the state class that lets us keep track of our current state, and where we came from
search.py will hold our breadth first search function
Opens a image and reads in a maze, creates an array of 1s and 0s to represent the maze
